1. Is the base class constructor being called when a derived class object is created? If yes, in what order?

Answer:
Yes, when a derived class object is created, the base class constructor is always called.
The base class constructor is executed before the derived class constructor.
This ensures that the base class part of the object is properly initialized first.

2. Can a derived class object be assigned to a base class reference? If yes, which Read_Data() method will be invoked?

Answer:
Yes, a derived class object can be assigned to a base class reference. This is known as upcasting.

If the Read_Data() method is not declared as virtual, the base class version of the method will be invoked.

If the Read_Data() method is declared as virtual in the base class and overridden in the derived class, then the derived class version of the method will be invoked at runtime.

3. Can a base class object be assigned to a derived class reference?

Answer:
No, a base class object cannot be assigned to a derived class reference directly.
This is because a base class object does not contain the additional members of the derived class, and such an assignment would violate type safety.
